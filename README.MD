**Wikipedia stores snapshots of the text of their entire library at https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/.  The link is the english version.  The goal of this project is to download the latest archive, 10/22, and then explore the data.  The goal will be to download a specific type of data (books, TV Shows, Movies, Podcasts, sports teams) and load into a database that can be used later.  After we have it stored in an easy to use format we can use the data for other data science, analytics and data visualization projects**

**This project is inspired by a [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/wikipedia-data-science-working-with-the-worlds-largest-encyclopedia-c08efbac5f5c) by [William Koehrsen](https://towardsdatascience.com/@williamkoehrsen).  He is using the data for a book recommendation deep learning project.**
